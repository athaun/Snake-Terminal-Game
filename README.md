# Snake Terminal Game
A single player snake game written in c++ that runs in the terminal.

Written in one week with my [friend](https://github.com/echo82). It was our first program made from scratch using C++

# Compiling and running
- requires g++
- Will only work on linux

Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/athaun/Snake-Terminal-Game.git```

cd into the repository
```cd ./Snake-Terminal-Game```

run
```g++ *.cpp -o snake.out```

run
```./snake.out```

Use WASD to move the snake around, collect food, and don't run into the walls or yourself.

## TODO:

* Change fruit spawn from reactionary to randomized timer
* Add color coding
* Look into snake segment appearing in the upper left hand corner on fruit eaten
